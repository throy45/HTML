              Hi, my name is Thomas! I am a Computer Science student with a BA
              in Economics. I'm looking to change the world for the better
              through smart data usage.

              The fact that I graduated first in my economics class demonstrates
              that I am a hard worker. Challenge is a great motivator for me: it
              drove me to run a full marathon, and it brought me to work in a
              field I never expected, the insurance sector. Remembering that as
              a teen, I was nervous to speak on the phone, I did not expect that
              in barely over a year I would become a great salesmen and customer
              service agent at Prysm assurances générales, a sub company of
              Industrielle Alliance. While I was there, I honed my interpersonal
              skills while I quickly took on all the tasks I could be given as
              an agent, in French and in English. I also had to analyze and
              evaluate every new client to make sure the company was accepting
              reasonable risk while staying away from precarious situations.
              Once I stopped learning new techniques and getting new
              responsibilities, I figured out that I was ready to move unto new
              challenges. This experience taught me that acquiring new knowledge
              is essential for me, and for my next job. For instance, my
              teachers, classmates and ex-coworkers can all testify that I’ll
              always prefer asking questions rather than sitting arms crossed.
              Moreover, I can easily express myself in English, and French is my
              beloved first language for which I have been a tutor in CÉGEP. All
              of these elements make me the dev you have been looking for.
